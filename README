Tamca (Tomato in lojban) is a simple timer meant to be used for the
Pomodoro Technique. It can be used from a shell with the tamca
command, or from a graphic session with the gtamca command.

tamca requires either the beep command or mplayer to play the sound at
the end of the timer.

gtamca requires GTK2 and OpenAL (with ALUT). It should be buildable on
Unix based systems and on Windows. The compilation requires CMake.
